## Overview of Project

#### The purpose of this analysis is to graph theater outcomes controlling for date and project goal to determine the best times of the year and the optimal financial goal for theater funding projects.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### The two conclusions reached with respect to launch date are that the most successful month for launching theater projects have been on May, with 111 successful attempts, 52 failed, and 3 canceled, while the least successful month was on December, with 37 successful attempts, 35 failed, and 3 canceled, the only month in which succesful attempts did not constitute a majority of all attempts.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### The most successful theater projects were ones that asked for the least amount of money, with a 76% success rate for projects asking for less than $1,000.  However, theater projects within the $45,000-$49,999 range have all failed, but the largest projects, those asking for $50,000 or greater, had a 13% success rate.  Upon further analysis, we can conclude that projects that asked for less than $20,000 have a favorable likelihood of succeeding, ranking no less than 50% a success rate.
